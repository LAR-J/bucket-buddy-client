How can a person make a bucket list in the modern age? Bucket Buddy is a single page application that collects users’ bucket lists and displays them in the browser. Bucket Buddy incorporates a social aspect to the app wherein the user can view other users’ bucket lists. This app uses the Mongo database, Express node ORM (object relational mapping), crypto node module for providing cryptographic functionality, the languages Javascript and HTML, and mark-up frameworks Bootstrap and Handlebars. 
Our group, named LAR-J, used past app development experiences to approach this project. That means forethought was key in our approach, both on the back-end and front. Our group addressed general concerns and whittled the code to more specific features as time went further. For instance, the database was developed comprehensively without the need for continuing alterations, as in adding collections and redeploying. The front end had a similar method. First, we compartmentalized the home page with modals then configured an extensive navigation bar for the main page. This approach can be appreciated by both the users and the development team.

Even the hurdles LAR-J faced can be appreciated, in a way. Hurdles like splitting app development by front and back end was valuable to experience so that the dev team can stress development by feature the next time an app is made. A considerable challenge was adding multiple functionality to a specific feature. This group made usernames plus profiles. The profiles are as multifunctional as they are time consuming. Also, new experiences with new technologies and programming techniques like team development and pair programming were the first time members in our team encountered them and will build from that experience. 
    
##User stories
Users come to the Bucket Buddy page to list their life goals and socially engage by viewing other user’s bucket lists.   
As developers, we want to create a NoSQL database to store user and profile information as well as user generated content like bucket items and lists.

As developers, we want to make a single page app that seamlessly directs a user from signing up and in to engaging with the main feature of the app, with that app talking to the database.
